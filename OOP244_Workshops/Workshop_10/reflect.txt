I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I learned how to code function templates and implement calls to function templates. 

Basically, I implemented two find() functions in this workshop which helped us to find an element in an array of a collection that was given to us earlier. However, in order to implement these find functions, we need an object of any collection type. A collection type could be a Car object, an Employee object, or a Student object. We would use this object to store the element that we found. Also, we need an Array that contains values/keys that we use to find elements in the object. Finally, we need the array where we will find the elements. By the search function is designed to be used with any type of collection because we have used function templates in the function definition.

The main problem that I faced in this workshop is that I was getting some errors in the search() template function. This was because the key arguments that I specified in the function call were not correct. I tried to pass by object type followed by the key string but the Car object has two string member which make the template function cannot compare between key and element inside because it does not know which member I want to compare.

// Before fixing the bug.
In main.cpp line 47:
if (search(Cres, C, 8, Car("Tesla"))); 	// Error because of two members of the Car object both are string.

// After fixing the bug.
In main.cpp line 47:
if (search(Cres, C, 8, "Tesla"))
