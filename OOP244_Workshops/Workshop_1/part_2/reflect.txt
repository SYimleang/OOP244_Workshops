In the workshop, I finished by using the modular concept and following the provided instruction in part one. to create the prototype of all functions in the header file of each .cpp file. Some header files like Files.h, I need to use the other header file which is related to some function in the different header files to accomplish this workshop and also need to do the namespace of all functions to make sure all of my files in this workshop are running on the same namespace. And the last one is to run and integrate all modules together with the main function and .csv file. 

For the DIY part, I need to study a little more deeply each string function and how they work, to get some ideas for creating my own cstring library.  After finishing the DIY part I got the concepts and some experience that can continue to use in this class.
